Code Command
==============


CLI tool for managing the daily problems solved on leetcode. 

Main focus would be to provide the following features:
- Generate templates to right code with necessary metadata
- Storage of the solved problems along with meta
	- In a well presented manner
	- To be used for revisions
- Stats (will be taken up later)
