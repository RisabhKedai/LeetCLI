# NOT STARTED:

	- Template generator for the code
		For a given leetcode problem link fetch all the details regarding that problem.
		The outcome should be a file with the following information:
			1. Create timestamp
			2. Update timestamp
			3. Edited by user
			4. Code space
			5. Approach string
			6. Time complexity
			7. Space complexity
			8. Time taken to solve.
			9. Tags
	
	- Termplate parser
	  To check whether the file being added by the user is  a valid file or not.

	- Timed Test:
	  Based on the problems solved generate a randomized contest with limited problems and time frame for revision
	  	* Use the sheet problems
		* Tags solved.

	- Config file
		A file to store things like:
		Link to the sheet to which this has to be added.
		Github repo to which this has to be pushed
		user credentials for the github id.

  	- Github Link Generator after push
  	  For each commit pushed find the files that have been part of that commit and generate their github link.
